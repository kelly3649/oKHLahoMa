## About the Project

*A photo a day keeps the amnesia away.* Team oKHLahoMa presents **Pic of the Day**, a photo blog website designed for photo-enthusiasts who understand the meaning of less is more. Users may upload a maximum of one photo a day, which can be filtered with the day’s featured filter. The goal is to upload each day and build up the streak, and achievements are awarded upon reaching certain streak benchmarks. 

Users can follow each other to receive their photos on their Feeds. Alternatively, users can visit a user’s profile page to see all of the user’s posts.
