## About the Project

*A photo a day keeps the amnesia away.* Team oKHLahoMa presents **Pic of the Day**, a photo blog website designed for photo-enthusiasts who understand the meaning of less is more. Users may upload a maximum of one photo a day, which can be filtered with the day’s mystery filter. The user may caption the photo and can ask the Spotify Genie for a song. The Spotify Genie will either switch out the caption for a song, or leave the caption. 

The goal is to upload each day and build up the streak. This way, you can document each day of your life one photo at a time!

Users can follow each other to receive their photos on their Feeds. Alternatively, users can visit a user’s profile page to see all of the user’s posts.
