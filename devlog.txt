component map for design doc

danielM -- 2017-01-09 20:55
created dbUtils and basic login functionality. Also built databases.

haleyZ -- 2017-01-09 14:00
began the master template, coded nav bar

haleyZ -- 2017-01-10 13:55
login and register page done basically

danielM -- 2017-01-10 14:00
added some methods for manipulating user data. Also added basic post functions.

haleyZ -- 2017-01-11 14:00
started the js data validation for log in and register

danielM -- 2017-01-11 14:00
Fixed some issues with login and db management. Deleted useless files.

danielM -- 2017-01-11 18:44
Entirely moved time functions from flask to dbUtils. Also wrote functions to get posts globally or for a user and a function to convert a post tuple to a dict. Dict has human-readable string as time and author is converted to username instead of id.

haleyZ -- 2017-01-12 00:08
continued the js data validation for log in and register -- error message on the page if failed to meet reg requirements.

haleyZ -- 2017-01-12 00:50
finished js for client-side form validation and added jinja spot for server-side error msg; started a homecooked-css file for logreg

haleyZ -- 2017-01-13 14:00
working on ajax in the register to check if username taken

haleyZ -- 2017-01-15 01:31
fixed up the arkansas functions so that the ajax registration username validation works

haleyZ -- 2017-01-17 14:00
fixed weird ajax bugs!!

edmondL -- 2016-01-17 15:00
One big devlog because he needs to remind himself to update devlog by himself, whoops.
Cleaned up the app to match any missing variables.
Mainpage/page routes set up for viewing posts and sending data about the previous and next pages.

Login and Register optimized to work with ajax, cleaned out unnecessary code.
Upload route finished for processing uploaded images.

danielM -- 2017-01-17 14:01
Renamed some things in db code.
Added getPages function to figure out how many pages we need.

danielM -- 2017-01-17 22:34
Did most of the upload page with js and all. Actual front-end should probably polish up the appearance but it looks pretty good right now.

haleyZ -- 2017-01-18 2:21
fixed the register ajax again, hopefully for the last time. made a template for the feed w/ a jinja loop for the posts.

danielM -- 2017-01-18 22:34
realized I had copied and pasted my devlogs too hard. fixed the dates. Also fixed the upload on the front and backend. Also added preview to images and made the submit button not exist until a photo was chosen.

kellyW -- 2017-01-19 12:59
realized profile button leads to nowhere, so added profile.html and its route
